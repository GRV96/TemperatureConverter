# temperature_converter
This repository contains two applications that can convert temperatures in
degrees Celsius, degrees Fahrenheit and kelvins. One is a GUI application;
the other is a command line application. Both depend on the same conversion
package.

The GUI application is started by class GuiConvApp. The GUI provides a text
field to enter a temperature and two selectors to set the input and output
scales. The temperature's decimal part must be separated from the integral part
by a point, not a comma. Another selector can change the GUI's language.

The command line application is started by class CmdLineConvApp. It takes three
arguments: the temperature, the input scale and the output scale. The
temperature's decimal part must be separated from the integral part by a point,
not a comma. The temperature scales can be represented with lower or upper case
letters or their symbol (째C, 째F, K). If the three arguments are valid, the
application outputs the converted temperature in the console. Here are examples
of valid command line arguments on Windows.
